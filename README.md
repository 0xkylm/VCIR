# VCIR
VCIR is a simple obfuscation VMs, the pe use 3 vms the 2 first vms uncipher opcode for the third vms.
The project contain a simple (really not good) pseudo compiler to write opcode from pseudo assembly.



The project is in early stage of development and is not ready for use.
The project is only for educational purpose.
# Todo:
  . Add injection methods

  . Add control flow obfuscation

  . Add connection to C2

  . More memory patching because it's fun

  . Upgrade the pseudo compiler

  . Why not try to create a real compiler / language
